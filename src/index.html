								<h2>Life Insurance</h2>
								<p>Generally, life insurance policies pay out a lump sum in the event of death or terminal illness. There are many types of life insurances and they are illustrated below:</p> 
								<ul class="alt">
									<li>Term Life Insurance</li>
									<li>Level Premium Life Insurance</li>
									<li>Accidental Life Insurance</li>
									<li>Funeral Cover</li>
								</ul>
								<div class="box">
									<p><i>Term Life insurance</i> is a policy in which the premium increases as you get older and therefore more expensive in the long run. They terminate when you reach the age of 100. This type of policy is useful if you have a mortgage and wish to ensure that the burden of debt does not pass on to your family members in the event of your untimely death. The inexorable rise of premiums can be controlled by reducing the sum assured as you gradually reduce your loan.</p>
									<p><i>Level Premium Life insurance</i> are policies where the premiums do not increase as you get older and remain fixed for the duration of the term you select. These types of policies are very cost effective in the long run and are very appropriate if you wish to keep your policy for more than 10 years or even longer. They are useful if you wish to bequeath a lump sum to a dear one or if there is a constant need for life insurance in the running of your business to cover business loans.</p>
									<p><i>Accidental Life Insurance</i> operates like a term life policy but only pay out if you die due to an accident. They do not cover you for death due to any sickness. The premiums are comparatively lower than term life insurance but do terminate when you reach 65 or 80 years of age. This type of policy can be supplemented with your normal term life insurance if you have a higher chance of dying from an accident. (E.g. truck driver).</p>
									<p><i>Funeral Covers</i> are guaranteed accepted policies. In other words, they are generally issued without any medical assessment of your health (except for age). As soon as your policy is in place you are covered for death resulting from an accident. For any other causes, during the first two years of the policy you will receive a full refund of any premiums paid. After that, you are fully covered for your selected cover amount whatever the cause of death. A funeral cover is a good option for someone who is not eligible to obtain any other life insurance due to a pre-existing health condition.</p>

							<h2>Trauma Cover</h2>
							<h4><b>What is Trauma Cover?</b></h4>
							<div class="box">
								<p>Trauma Insurance pays out a lump sum in the event you suffer a specified serious sickness such as a Heart Attack, Cancer, Stroke, Advanced Diabetes, Organ failures and many other serious illnesses. Generally, in order to claim under this policy, you must survive this serious sickness for at least 14 days. This cover is also known by other names such as Critical Illness cover or Living Assurance cover. You may take this cover as part of your Life cover or as a separate standalone policy.</p>
							</div>
							<h4><b>Why take the Trauma Cover?</b></h4>
							<div class="box">
								<p>Every adult would probably know someone in their life who has suffered or died from one of these serious sicknesses. Let us look at a few shocking statistics of serious sicknesses in New Zealand. </p>
								<ul>
									<li>There are 16 deaths a day due to coronary heart disease in New Zealand.*</li>
									<li>Over 5000 women died of cardiovascular disease in 2009.*</li>
									<li>2000 people die from strokes every year in NZ. It is the 3rd largest cause of death in NZ.*</li>
									<li>Cancer is the leading cause of death in NZ among men and women, accounts for almost 30% of all deaths.**</li>
									<li>Heart Attacks, Cancer and Strokes account for 90% of all deaths in NZ.**</li>
								</ul>
								<p><i>*Heart Foundation of NZ; **Ministry of  Health</i></p>
							</div>
							<p>As you can see, it is no brainer as to why you should have this cover. It is not a matter of if, but when a serious sickness will strike you. You cannot predict, but certainly, protect yourself from financial and emotional strain. Most trauma covers are generally one-time payment covers.</p>

								<h2>Income Protection Cover</h2>
								<div class="box">
									<p>Income Protection (IP) Cover protects one of your most important assets – your income. It pays a percentage of your lost income if you are disabled and unable to work due to an illness or injury. This could help pay your bills and meet other financial commitments while your off work, allowing you to focus on your well-being and recovery. SEVEN out of every TEN FEMALES  aged 25 years old are likely to become disabled due to an illness or accident before they turn 65 that will prevent them from working for at least a month. Of these (men or women) nearly a third will still be on claim 12 months later.</p>

							<div class="box">
								<p>You may ask the question as to why I need private health insurance when New Zealand has the world’s best public health care. Unknowingly to many of us, the public health care system expedites access when you experience a serious illness or emergencies, but you could wait for months or even years for non-urgent care. Non-urgent care includes ailments like hip or joint replacements, even certain cardiac replacements, or cataract removals.* A delay in treatment of these non-urgent conditions could possibly have an impact on your quality of life. Give us a call and we will explain the benefits of private insurance and set up a policy for you and your family.</p>
